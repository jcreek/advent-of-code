# Advent Of Code

To create a new day's files, run the DayCreator project and specify the year (e.g. `2015`) and the day (e.g. `1` for Day01). This can be done in vscode by running `dotnet run --project "DayCreator"` in the terminal.

The solutions to both parts of each day of each year can be executed using the Test Explorer.
