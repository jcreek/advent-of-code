# Advent of Code

This repository contains all of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware. Some people even solve the problems using a spreadsheet!

Since 2021 all of my solutions can be found within the `AdventOfCode` folder for any given language. All prior (and less clean) solutions can be found in the `old` folder.
